    <h1>The story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been starting out off her window for about an hour now. One her desk. Lying between the copies of <1>
            Nature</1>. <1>New Scientist</1>. and all the other scientific journals her works had appeared in. was a
        well thumbed copy of<cite> On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book sice college. and the longer
        she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>>. Although many considered her pioneering
        work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
        achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
